# Mastery Signature

Welcome to **Mastery Signature**, a transformative tool designed to help students visualize their journey toward mastering a career, hobby, or passion.

## Features

- **Mastery Progress Score**: A 1-7 score based on average time across levels, revealing your current stage and balance.
- **Tier Classification**: Classified as a "Tier One Candidate" or "Advanced Learner" based on engagement with higher levels.
- **Future Projections**: Estimate mastery levels for 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 years with consistent effort.
- **Next Steps Guidance**: Receive personalized advice to enhance your path.
- **Download and Share**: Export your Mastery Signature as a PNG or copy it to your clipboard.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices.

## Philosophical Framework: The Seven Levels of Mastery
This tool is built on a narrative of growth, inspired by iconic moments and contributions:
1. **Initial Experience (The First Kiss)**: The spark that draws you in—hours per week of engaging, motivating experiences (e.g., Einstein’s compass, Jordan’s varsity cut).
2. **General Education**: Time spent learning established knowledge about your discipline.
3. **Experience (Doing)**: Dedicated effort in doing—volunteering, interning, work, or gameplay (for athletes, practice is Level 2, gameplay is Level 3).
4. **Sharing**: Time invested in teaching, tutoring, public speaking, or informal sharing.
5. **Amalgamation**: Effort to blend your discipline with other fields, exploring variations or new ideas.
6. **Contribution**: Devotion to the discipline itself, through publications or roles (e.g., an NBA player becoming commissioner).
7. **Innovation (The Rare Newton Moment)**: The rare creation of something new, often from Levels 5 or 6 (e.g., Newton’s calculus out of necessity).

Your Mastery Blossom reflects this journey, with shorter petals highlighting areas to focus on.

## How It Works
1. **Start the Journey**: Enter the discipline or passion you’re mastering (e.g., Guitar, Python Programming, Basketball).
2. **Answer Questions**: Progress through seven questions, selecting time spent and difficulty for each level.
3. **View Results**: Discover your Mastery Blossom, score, tier, projections, and next steps.
4. **Customize and Save**: Adjust your inputs and download your unique signature.

# Mastery Signature

Welcome to **Mastery Signature**, a tool designed to visualize your journey toward mastering any skill or discipline! This interactive application creates a unique "Mastery Blossom" graphic, where each petal represents a level of mastery, reflecting the time and effort you've invested. Use it to assess your progress, identify areas for growth, and plan your future development.

## Features
- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Answer questions about your time and difficulty across seven levels of mastery (Initial Exposure, Learning Known Knowledge, Active Application, Reflection, Integration, Contribution, and Innovation).
- **Mastery Blossom Visualization**: See your progress as a dynamic blossom, with petal length indicating time invested and width reflecting difficulty.
- **Mastery Progress Score**: Receive a 1-7 score based on your average time across levels, helping you gauge your overall mastery stage.
- **Tier Classification**: Classified as a "Tier One Candidate" or "Advanced Learner" based on your engagement with higher levels.
- **Future Projections**: Get estimated mastery levels for 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 years with consistent effort.
- **Next Steps Guidance**: Receive tailored advice to enhance your mastery journey.
- **Download and Share**: Export your Mastery Signature as a PNG or copy it to your clipboard.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.

## How It Works
1. **Start the Journey**: Enter the discipline or skill you're mastering (e.g., Guitar, Python Programming).
2. **Answer Questions**: Progress through seven questions, selecting time spent and difficulty for each mastery level.
3. **View Results**: See your Mastery Blossom, score, tier, projections, and next steps.
4. **Customize and Save**: Adjust your inputs and download your unique signature.

## Understanding Your Mastery Progress Score
The Mastery Progress Score (1-7) reflects your overall progress across the seven levels of mastery. It is calculated by averaging the time you've spent on each level (excluding levels with no time invested) and mapping this average to a 1-7 scale. A score of 1 indicates early stages (e.g., hours to days of engagement), while a score of 7 signifies extensive dedication (e.g., 5+ years across multiple levels). This score helps you gauge your current stage and identify how balanced your efforts are across different levels.

## Customization
- **Labels**: All time and level labels are now placed on top of the graphic and within the 500x500 pixel canvas bounds for better visibility.
- **Title**: The title includes the discipline you entered (e.g., "Guitar Mastery Progress: 3") and features an attractive shadow effect for contrast, removing the previous white background.
- **Colors**: The blossom uses a gradient color scheme for each level, with an optional tan infinity ring for advanced learners.

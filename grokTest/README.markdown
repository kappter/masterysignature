# Mastery Signature

## Overview

Mastery Signature is an interactive web app that visualizes your journey toward mastering a skill or discipline. By answering questions about the time and effort you’ve invested across seven levels of mastery—from initial exposure to innovation—you generate a unique "mastery signature." This signature is displayed as a vibrant, chakra-colored circular symbol, where segment lengths represent time invested and thickness reflects the difficulty of each level. The app provides real-time previews, a final visualization, and future projections to help you set goals and track your progress.

## Features

- **Self-Assessment**: Evaluate your experience across seven levels of mastery, from initial exposure to innovation.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Watch your mastery signature take shape as a circular graphic, with each level represented by a chakra color.
- **Goal-Setting**: View future projections for 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 years to plan your growth.
- **Actionable Insights**: Receive tailored advice based on your classification as a "Tier One Candidate" or "Advanced Learner."
- **Export Options**: Download or copy your mastery signature as an image to share or keep as a milestone.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive navigation with real-time feedback and accessibility features.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Your Discipline**: Specify the skill or discipline you’re mastering (e.g., Python Programming, Painting).
2. **Answer Questions**: For each of the seven levels, indicate the time you’ve spent and the difficulty of your efforts.
3. **View Your Signature**: See a real-time preview of your mastery signature as you answer, culminating in a final circular visualization.
4. **Review Results**: Learn your average mastery level, classification, and future projections, along with actionable next steps.
5. **Save or Share**: Download or copy your mastery signature to track your progress or share with others.

## Use Cases

- **Personal Development**: Reflect on your progress in a hobby, professional skill, or academic subject.
- **Education and Coaching**: Help students or clients assess their skills and set learning objectives.
- **Motivation**: Visualize your dedication and challenges to stay inspired on your mastery journey.

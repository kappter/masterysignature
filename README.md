## Mastery Signature App Description

Mastery Signature is a dynamic web app designed to help you visualize and track your journey toward mastery in any discipline. By answering a series of questions about the time you’ve invested and the challenges you’ve faced across seven levels of mastery—from initial exposure to innovation—you’ll create a unique "mastery signature." This signature is represented as a vibrant, chakra-colored circle or infinity symbol, with segment lengths proportional to your experience and thickness reflecting the difficulty of each level. As you answer, watch your signature come to life in real-time, culminating in a final visualization that classifies you as a "Tier One Candidate" or "Advanced Learner" based on your progress.

## What can it be used for?

* Self-Assessment: Gain insight into your current level of mastery in any skill or discipline, identifying strengths and areas for growth.

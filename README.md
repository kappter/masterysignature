### Additional Notes for the README

1. **Screenshot**: The README references a `screenshot.png` file. You can take a screenshot of the app (e.g., the result page with the infinity symbol) and place it in the repository root. Alternatively, you can remove the screenshot section if you don't want to include one.

2. **Repository Link**: Replace `https://github.com/your-username/infinitymaster.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository once you create it.

3. **License File**: The README mentions a `LICENSE` file. You can create a simple MIT License file in your repository by adding a `LICENSE` file with the following content:

   ```markdown
